## 3. Results and Discussion

### 3.1. Chemical and Microstructural Modulation

The basal characterization of *in natura* fibers (Table 2) constitutes the initial analytical reference, in which the lignin/cellulose ratio (L/C = 0.44) and the crystallinity index of 48.5% delineate a predominantly amorphous and hygroscopic matrix. This compositional configuration is consistent with a high density of reactive sites and free volumes, which favors water diffusion and susceptibility to hydrolysis and photo-oxidation mechanisms that precede mechanical degradation [@Bouramdane2022; @Silva2009].

FTIR spectroscopy evidences the efficacy of the alkaline treatment by the attenuation of the band at 1735 cm⁻¹, associated with the stretching of carbonyl groups (C=O) in hemicelluloses and pectins. As observed by @Pandey1999, the selective removal of these amorphous constituents raises the relative proportion of the crystalline cellulosic fraction and the aromatic lignin skeleton, a phenomenon also described by @Faix1991, which may reduce cell wall hydrophilicity. As discussed by @Poletto2014 and @Mwaikambo2002, the suppression of these vibrational modes suggests the transition to a state of lower chemical reactivity, potentially limiting the initiation of oxidative processes.

Crystallographic data (XRD) are compatible with this structural reorganization, registering an increase in the crystallinity index from 48.5% (Control) to 62.3% (9% NaOH). This evolution reflects the removal of disordered regions and the reorientation of cellulose microfibrils, as detailed by @Chieng2017 and @Yang2024, which may result in a more compact supramolecular architecture. The reduction of amorphous volume tends to restrict the diffusive path for water and oxidizing agents, possibly acting as a physical barrier that retards the kinetics of degradation reactions [@Hiyama2006; @Yamane2006].

Morphological analysis (SEM) reflects these chemical alterations in geometric metrics of interaction with the environment. Treated fibers exhibit a surface free of impurities and with increased roughness (Figure 8), while morphometry (N=36) quantifies a reduction in average porosity from 75.8% (Natural) to 26.3% (9% NaOH). According to @Carvalho2014, this densification can minimize the specific surface area available for microbial colonization and moisture absorption, while the increase in roughness (452 to 1549) indicates potential improvement in mechanical anchorage in the soil matrix [@Geremew2024; @Sinha2017].

### 3.2. Mechanical Degradation Kinetics

The kinetic quantification of mechanical degradation strengthens the hypothesis that chemical modification can act as a factor retarding functional obsolescence. Figure 7 illustrates the temporal evolution of Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) and maximum strain.

Longitudinal analysis evidences the superior performance of treatment T3 (9% NaOH), which sustains an average strength of 18.2 ± 8.2 MPa, statistically distinct from the control (5.5 ± 3.3 MPa; p < 0.001) according to Bonferroni corrections and Kruskal-Wallis test (H = 25.08). GEE modeling corroborates this distinction by indicating a significant temporal decline for all groups (-0.091 MPa/day, p < 0.001), but with an interaction term that favors the stability of treated fibers (Figure 7).

Ductility can be considered a sensitive indicator of the functional limit state, anticipating the brittle transition that compromises the geotextile's ability to accommodate soil deformations. The untreated fiber collapses to ductility below 5% in 180 days, while alkaline treatments preserve deformability above 6%, delaying embrittlement. This preservation is associated with the removal of hemicelluloses, which, according to @Hatakka2011, @Santos2023_GeocompostosTypha, function in the natural state as preferential sites for moisture absorption and fungal attack. The stabilization of deformation capacity may therefore reflect a mechanical consequence of the reduction in biological and chemical susceptibility of the matrix [@Kabir2012].

Kinetic parameterization (Table 2) quantifies the durability gain by demonstrating that mercerization reduces the decay constant ($k$) and extends the half-life ($t_{1/2}$). Treatment T3 maximizes property retention, reaching a strength half-life of 91.2 days against 48.8 days for the control.

In the design context, this extension is critical to ensure mechanical integrity during the vegetation establishment window [@Veylon2015]. The reduction in the ductility degradation rate ($k$ from 0.0355 to 0.0198 day⁻¹) supports the viability of treated fibers for applications demanding long-term deformation compatibility [@Mwaikambo2002; @Rong2001].

The correlation between macroscopic performance and accumulated damage is substantiated by fracture density analysis (Figure 8b), which maps the physical evolution of discontinuities. Fracture growth in the control (45 to 185 mm⁻²) contrasts with the stabilization observed in the most aggressive treatment (128 mm⁻²), which is compatible with the premise that higher crystallinity and lower porosity impede crack propagation [@Dalirnasab2024; @Kabir2012].

This microstructural evidence connects the scales of analysis, suggesting that improved durability results directly from a fibrous architecture less prone to defect nucleation under environmental stress [@Luchese2024; @Kwon2021].

### 3.3. Stochastic and Predictive Modeling

The regime transition induced by mercerization appears to shift the failure behavior towards a pattern of greater determinism, as evidenced by the Weibull distribution (Figure 9). The increase in the shape modulus ($\beta$) from 2.3 (Control) to 3.0 (9% NaOH) is consistent with the reduction in failure time dispersion. @Rong2001 and @Luqman2023 associate this behavior with microstructural homogenization and the elimination of critical defects. From a geotechnical design perspective, the conservative metric $P_{10}$ quantifies the reliability gain: treatment T2 (6% NaOH) extends the functional service life to 95 days, surpassing the 42 days of the control and mitigating the risk of premature collapse in the stabilization phase [@Sekulic2017].

The integration of thermal-kinetic dynamics via hybrid calibration supports the system's predictability under environmental variability. Wherein, the activation energy ($E_a = 29.03$ kJ/mol), determined via the Arrhenius equation by comparing degradation rates in the field ($k \approx 0.0118$ day⁻¹) and in the UV chamber ($k \approx 0.0199$ day⁻¹), suggests that the failure mechanism lies in the range of coupled hydrolysis and photo-oxidation of lignocellulosic matrices [@OrnaghiJr2024; @Wei2014]. The consistency between accelerated projections and empirical records (Figure 8a) indicates the viability of short-duration tests in capturing degradation physics, allowing for robust temporal extrapolations [@Wei2014].

The numerical robustness of the fits, verified via non-parametric *bootstrap* (1000 iterations), demonstrates normality in the distribution of kinetic parameters (Kolmogorov-Smirnov: $p = 0.41$). The absence of *overfitting* is attested by the proximity between the cross-validation error ($RMSE_{cv} = 0.000127$ day⁻¹) and the fitting error, resulting in the ratio $RMSE_{cv}/RMSE_{train} = 1.10$, a criterion that, according to @Sodagar2025, favors model generalization to unobserved data.

Physical validity limits manifest under high irradiance regimes, where the linearity of the photochemical response is compromised. Predictions maintain relative error below 10% under partial shading (UV ≤ 0.5), but extreme exposure (UV = 1,0) raises the divergence to 28%, indicating the need for non-linear corrections for high-altitude environments or arid climates [@Andrady2019; @Aldosary2025; @wieser2023]. The strong correlation (r = 0.82) between embrittlement kinetics and oxidation markers in FTIR suggests, however, that mechanical degradation remains governed by the chemical evolution of the matrix [@Tanasa2022; @Silva2024].

### 3.4. Protocol and Geotechnical Implications

The technical specification of natural geotextiles recommends replacing deterministic averages with probabilistic safety margins, aligning with structural reliability practices via the adoption of the $P_{10}$ percentile, as advocated by @ISO2394 and @Phoon2021. Empirical evidence supports the definition of performance thresholds based on a minimum initial strength of 20 kN/m, VUF ≥ 90 days, and crystallinity index greater than 60%, establishing the reduction of maximum strain ($\varepsilon_{\text{max}}$) to 2.0% as the terminal functionality criterion.

Treatment selection (Figure 10) is based on the integration of rapid characterization tests (L/C, CI, FTIR) with VUF estimates weighted by environmental aggressiveness and ductility requirements. Untreated material is restricted to temporary interventions in low-aggressiveness scenarios (30–60 days) [@Pritchard2000; @Methacanon2010], while the 6% NaOH treatment (T2) presents itself as a technical-economic equilibrium point for tropical slopes. This concentration extends the VUF to 95 days (+127%) preserving functional ductility (2.8%), unlike the 9% concentration (T3) which, although maximizing durability, induces embrittlement ($\varepsilon_{\text{max}} < 2.0%$) compatible only with rigid reinforcement or base containment applications [@Syed2021; @Kafodya2020; @Holanda2024].

The viability of large-scale adoption is supported by the environmental and economic advantage over conventional geosynthetics. The carbon footprint reduced by 60–70% compared to polypropylene [@Shamsuddoha2025; @Soares2023] combines with operational efficiency in large-scale works (10,000 m²), where the incremental cost of treatment (R$ 180–220/ton) is absorbed by the extension of service life and consequent reduction in maintenance frequency, generating estimated savings between R$ 50,000 and R$ 70,000 annually.

The applicability of the protocol is subordinate to the local irradiance regime, as the non-linearity of the photochemical response under extreme UV (index 1.0) introduces predictive deviations that require *in situ* validation or parametric correction to avoid risk underestimation [@Andrady2019]. Under humid tropical slope conditions, however, the validated causal chain — from chemical modulation to mechanical reliability — offers a robust quantitative basis for the engineering of nature-based solutions.

## 4. Conclusion

The validation of the hierarchical model connecting chemical recalcitrance to functional service life represents the central contribution of this study, indicating that the durability of natural geotextiles is not a stochastic artifact, but a deterministic response to compositional architecture. The experimental trajectory evidenced that the removal of hemicelluloses and the consequent crystalline reorganization induced by mercerization can act as a governing mechanism for the retardation of mechanical degradation.

The identification of the 6% NaOH treatment as the technical-economic optimum transcends mere parameter optimization, delimiting a boundary condition where the reliability gain does not compromise the essential deformability for soil-geotextile interaction. While the 9% concentration maximizes tensile strength, the resulting embrittlement violates ductility requirements for slope stabilization, exemplifying the trade-off between chemical recalcitrance and mechanical compliance.

The adoption of the $P_{10}$ reliability metric converts this understanding into engineering specification, allowing *Typha domingensis* fibers to be prescribed with safety margins comparable to synthetic counterparts, provided the irradiance regime remains within the validated envelope.

This investigation repositions natural geotextiles from alternative materials to engineering solutions, grounded in a predictive framework that integrates microstructural evidence and probabilistic design.

The demonstrated capability to estimate long-term performance via rapid compositional tests reduces dependence on prolonged field tests, accelerating the technological transfer of bioengineering solutions. The future perspective involves expanding the model to other fibrous species and incorporating additional environmental variables, such as relative humidity and temperature, aiming to broaden the applicability of the decision protocol in diverse geographical contexts.
