## Abstract

The replacement of petrochemical geosynthetics with biodegradable materials constitutes an imperative for mitigating microplastic pollution in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although alkaline treatment is widely employed to extend the durability of natural fiber geotextiles, the definition of an optimized protocol for soil bioengineering lacks consensus. The present investigation validated a hierarchical model that connects fundamental chemical composition, specifically the lignin/cellulose ratio, to Functional Useful Life (FUL) at 10% failure probability, evaluating the degradation resistance of geotextiles manufactured from *Typha domingensis* fibers subjected to alkaline modifications. Tensile strength tests conducted over 180 days enabled parametrization of the degradation kinetics of fibers treated with NaOH (3%, 6%, and 9%). The integration of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that alkaline treatment modulates chemical recalcitrance through selective hemicellulose removal. The results indicate that 6% NaOH treatment established an operational equilibrium point, balancing FUL gain (95 days, +127% over control) with ductility preservation (ε_max = 2.8%), while 9% concentration induced excessive embrittlement. Temporal analysis revealed that the exponential decay model adequately describes embrittlement kinetics, evidencing that the lignin/cellulose ratio governs the degradation rate through an inverse exponential relationship. The main methodological contribution resides in confirming that the fitted model allows estimating temporal reliability from rapid compositional assays, reducing dependence on prolonged field tests and consolidating *Typha* fibers treated with 6% NaOH as a sustainable alternative for erosion control on tropical slopes, in alignment with circular economy principles and ecological footprint reduction in geotechnics.

## 1. Introduction

The intensification of global climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme events drive the search for resilient and environmentally responsible solutions for erosion control, a central challenge in contemporary scientific, technological, and environmental management agendas [@Pazhanivelan2025]. The predominance of petrochemical materials in traditional geosynthetics reveals, however, an intrinsic contradiction: while mitigating erosive processes, these materials contribute to persistent plastic pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, given their high embodied energy and long environmental permanence [@Koerner2016; @Sanjay2019].

Soil bioengineering promotes this transition through the use of renewable materials whose controlled degradability and low environmental impact confront petrochemical persistence. Biocomposites reinforced with lignocellulosic fibers materialize this disruption, as their low density, high specific strength, programmable biodegradability, and broad territorial availability converge with circular economy principles and green infrastructure [@Karimah2021]. Concurrently, the interaction between roots and natural geotextiles enhances soil stability and resistance to hydraulic erosion, mimicking natural ecological succession processes [@Niu2017; @Vannoppen2017].

The architecture of these fibers combines crystalline cellulose, amorphous hemicelluloses, and aromatic lignin. The lignin/cellulose (L/C) ratio acts as a determinant of durability and degradation resistance [@Reinhardt2022; @Rowell1998], defining the chemical recalcitrance of the matrix through the proportion between the aromatic phase and the crystalline fraction.

The transposition of lignocellulosic materials from laboratory to field applications faces limitations that conventional mechanical characterization does not capture, since prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation and hygrothermal cycles accelerates photooxidation and acid hydrolysis preferentially, with ductility degrading before ultimate tensile strength [@Sathishkumar2022]. This temporal sequence defines the functional collapse of the geotextile, as the inability to accommodate soil deformations precedes tensile rupture, determining that understanding and manipulating chemical and structural instability mechanisms is more relevant to geotechnological viability than mere initial resistance.

Surface modifications mitigate these effects through controlled alteration of interfacial chemistry. Alkaline treatment reduces hydrophilicity, increases interfacial compatibility, removes hemicelluloses, and enhances surface roughness, modulating chemical compatibility and mechanical anchorage between fibers and matrices [@Gurunathan2015; @Tanasa2022]. These structural transformations extend durability and favor desirable ecological interactions in bioengineering, since natural geotextiles function as substrates for root colonization, contributing to biological soil stabilization through biomechanical coupling.

*Typha domingensis* materializes this multifunctional convergence by presenting high biomass productivity [@Fontes2021], favorable lignocellulosic composition with a particularly high L/C ratio [@Fontes2021], wide distribution in tropical wetland environments [@Grace1989; @Manning2018], and presence of bioactive metabolites that confer integrated mechanical, hydraulic, and ecological performance [@Manning2018]. The literature, however, neglects critical aspects, as systematic studies on mechanical resilience under real weathering are scarce and quantitative relationships between fundamental chemical parameters and in-service performance remain unexplored.

Traditional fibers such as sisal and flax have consolidated literature on aging and degradation mechanisms, while *Typha domingensis* lacks in-depth investigations on its response to photodegradation and prolonged environmental exposure. The absence of a unified predictive model capable of connecting basic chemical composition to the FUL of natural geotextiles constitutes a critical gap for standardization, certification, and technological adoption [@Silveira2021].

The central hypothesis postulates that the lignin/cellulose (L/C) ratio determines the chemical recalcitrance of the matrix, governing the degradation rate. Validating this predictive hierarchy in which chemical composition determines degradation kinetics that, in turn, defines temporal reliability would allow estimating Functional Useful Life (FUL) through rapid compositional assays, suppressing dependence on prolonged field tests.

The objective of this study consists of validating this hierarchical model by connecting fundamental chemical composition (lignin/cellulose ratio) to Functional Useful Life (FUL) at 10% failure probability, through analysis of degradation resistance of geotextiles produced from *Typha domingensis* fibers subjected to alkaline modifications. The success of validation resides in demonstrating that the fitted model can predict, with acceptable uncertainty, whether the material will maintain the necessary ductility during the long-term critical window, an essential period for vegetation cover establishment in bioengineering projects.


## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Hierarchical Model Architecture

The selection of the species *Typha domingensis* Pers. was based on its mechanical properties and cellulose and lignin contents reported in the literature.

This aquatic macrophyte, which typically reaches between 2 and 3 meters in height, has long and flat leaves and is traditionally used in the manufacture of handicrafts and roofing. Its robustness is attributed to high cellulose content, and beyond its ecological importance as a natural filter in wetlands, the species has a broad spectrum of uses (Figure 1).

The collection of leaves and shoots was carried out in Tigre Village, belonging to the municipality of Pacatuba, State of Sergipe, northeastern Brazil (Figure 2).

Formal botanical identification was performed by the Botany Laboratory of the Institute of Biology of the Federal University of Bahia, with exsiccates deposited in the Herbarium of the Federal University of Sergipe. In compliance with Brazilian legislation for access to genetic heritage, collection activities were registered in the National System for the Management of Genetic Heritage and Associated Traditional Knowledge (SisGen) under code A2B3842.

The geotextile prototypes were manufactured by the Erosion and Sedimentation Laboratory of the Federal University of Sergipe, following a four-stage process: (i) fiber cutting and drying; (ii) grouping; (iii) weaving; and (iv) alkaline chemical treatment. Fiber extraction used smooth-blade tools to preserve fiber integrity, with incisions made above the root system to allow regrowth.

Chemical treatment aimed to modify the fiber surface to reduce hydrophilicity and delay degradation. Geotextile mats were immersed in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions at concentrations of 3% (0.75 mol/L), 6% (1.5 mol/L), and 9% (2.25 mol/L) for a period of 24 hours, maintaining a constant bath ratio.

After the reaction, the material was washed in running water until neutralization and air-dried. Drying occurred in the shade for approximately 8 days.

Subsequently, the fibers were manually braided to form cords with an average diameter of 6 mm, which constituted the biaxial weft of the geogrid-type geotextile (reinforcement grid). The mesh was configured in a checkerboard pattern with 25 cm² openings, totaling an area of 1.20 m² per unit (Figure 3a). This geogrid configuration allows for soil blockage and confinement while providing adequate drainage.

The natural degradation monitoring was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Rural Campus of the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS), located in the municipality of São Cristóvão – SE (16°55′S, 36°66′O). The experimental area consists of a slope with a 45° inclination, constituted by Dystrophic Haplic Plinthosol (Figure 3b).

The experiment was conducted in a Latin square design with 0.60 m x 2.40 m plots with geotextiles (geogrids) arranged in the slope direction, simulating real application conditions (Figure 3c). Samples were exposed to local environmental variables (solar radiation, precipitation, wind) and interaction with spontaneous vegetation cover, whose development was recorded monthly.

Samples were exposed to the humid subtropical climate characteristic of the region, whose precipitation and solar irradiance patterns throughout the experimental period are documented in Figure 4. The pluviometric regime exhibited seasonality typical of the northeastern coast, with rainfall concentration between April and August, accumulating approximately 1400 mm during the 180 days of monitoring. Global solar irradiance remained predominantly between 18 and 22 MJ m⁻² day⁻¹, with temporary attenuation during cloudiness events associated with rainy periods.

For biodegradation kinetics evaluation, 20 cm × 20 cm sections were removed from the central portion of plots at scheduled intervals, aiming to avoid edge effects. In the laboratory, these samples were oven-dried at 60 °C for 24 hours before specimen preparation. The exposure period extended for 180 days, with collections performed at seven discrete intervals: T0 (0 days), T1 (30 days), T2 (60 days), T3 (90 days), T4 (120 days), T5 (150 days), and T6 (180 days), with five replicates per experimental point to ensure statistical robustness.


### 2.2. Physicochemical and Microstructural Characterization

Functional group analysis was performed on an FTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Spectrum Two), operating in transmission mode. Samples were prepared by the KBr pellet method (1 mg of ground fiber to 100 mg of spectroscopic KBr). Spectra were acquired in the range of 4000 to 400 cm⁻¹, with 4 cm⁻¹ resolution and accumulation of 32 scans.

Interpretation of vibrational bands was based on the seminal works of @Pandey1999 and @Faix1991, focusing on the 1735 cm⁻¹ band (C=O stretching of hemicelluloses) and 1505 cm⁻¹ (aromatic ring vibration of lignin) to evaluate selective removal of amorphous components.

The crystalline structure was analyzed on an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, XRD-6000), using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. Scans were performed in the 2θ interval from 5° to 40°, with a speed of 2°/min. The Crystallinity Index (CI) was calculated by the empirical peak height method proposed by @Segal1959 (Equation 1):

$$
CI (\%) = \frac{I_{002} - I_{am}}{I_{002}} \times 100
$$

Where $I_{002}$ is the maximum intensity of the diffraction peak of the crystalline plane (002) at 2θ ≈ 22.5° and $I_{am}$ is the intensity of amorphous material diffraction at 2θ ≈ 18°.

Surface morphology and fracture mode were examined on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, TM3000). Samples were fixed on aluminum supports with conductive carbon tape and metallized with a thin gold (Au) layer in a sputter coater (Denton Vacuum, Desk V) to avoid electrostatic charging. Images were acquired with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV under high vacuum.

Thermal stability was evaluated on a thermogravimetric analyzer (Shimadzu, TGA-50). Samples of approximately 10 mg were heated from 25°C to 600°C at a rate of 10°C/min, under dynamic nitrogen (N₂) flow of 50 mL/min.

Mass loss (TG) curves and their derivatives (DTG) were used to identify decomposition stages of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, according to the methodology described by @Popescu2011.

### 2.3. Tensile Mechanical Tests

Tensile strength and elongation at break were determined on a Universal Testing Machine (EMIC, DL-3000), equipped with a 500 N load cell. Tests were conducted according to ASTM D5035 standard (Wide Strip Method), using specimens with dimensions of 200 mm x 50 mm, useful length of 100 mm, and displacement speed of 20 mm/min. At least 5 specimens were tested for each treatment condition and exposure time.

### 2.4. Statistical and Probabilistic Modeling

#### 2.4.1. Degradation Kinetics and Reliability

Mechanical degradation was modeled assuming first-order kinetics ($P(t) = P_0 \cdot e^{-k \cdot t}$), with parameters estimated by non-linear regression (Levenberg-Marquardt). The selection of the exponential model was comparatively validated against power ($P(t) = a \cdot t^b$) and logarithmic ($P(t) = a + b \cdot \ln(t)$) models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). 

For treated fibers (T2 and T3), the exponential model presented the best fit (lowest AIC), while for natural fibers (T0) and lightly treated (T1), results were statistically equivalent to the logarithmic model ($\Delta AIC < 2$). The exponential model was chosen due to its physicochemical foundation in first-order degradation kinetics, consistent with hydrolysis and oxidation of natural polymers.

The temporal failure probability followed the two-parameter Weibull distribution (Equation 3), where the FUL corresponds to the time for 10% failure ($P_{10}$).

$$
R(t) = \exp\left[ -\left( \frac{t}{\eta} \right)^\beta \right]
$$

Uncertainty of parameters ($k$, $\eta$, $\beta$) was quantified via non-parametric *bootstrap* (1000 resamplings, 95% CI).

#### 2.4.2. Statistical Analyses

The longitudinal structure of the experiment (4 treatments × 6 times × 3 replicates) was analyzed through Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with Gaussian family and *exchangeable* correlation, robust for repeated measures. Between-group comparisons employed Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (Bonferroni correction), with effect size measured by Cohen's *d*. Predictive model validation included *leave-one-out* cross-validation (LOOCV) and Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations) under variable UV irradiance scenarios. Analyses were conducted in Python 3.13.2 (`scipy`, `statsmodels`, `lifelines`) and R 4.3.1 (`ggplot2`).

### 2.5. Hybrid Simulation

To calibrate predictive service life models, an accelerated degradation test was performed in a custom UV chamber, following adaptations of the EN 12224:2001 standard. The irradiation system combined UV-A (315–400 nm), UV-B (280–315 nm), and visible (450–700 nm) fluorescent lamps, simulating the global solar spectrum with average irradiance of 6,214 W/m² (UV-A) and 2,281 W/m² (UV-B) (Figure 3).

The experimental protocol consisted of 120 cycles of 6 hours, totaling 720 hours of exposure. Each cycle comprised three stages: (i) immersion in water for 15 min; (ii) oven drying at 105°C for 1 h; and (iii) UV radiation exposure for 4 h 45 min. Internal temperature was controlled by black panel thermometer at 40 ± 3°C, with relative humidity maintained at approximately 60%.

Hybrid simulation integrated kinetic data obtained from chamber simulation ($k_{\text{chamber}}$) with natural field degradation data ($k_{\text{field}}$), allowing determination of experimental Activation Energy ($E_a$) via Arrhenius equation. Additionally, damage evolution was modeled by the modified Paris-Erdoğan law, where the crack growth parameter ($m$) was calibrated using the Weibull modulus ($\beta$), seeking to establish a bridge between static failure probability and dynamic degradation kinetics.
