   abstract = {<p>Plant fibers (PFs), such as hemp, Coir, and straw, are abundant in resources, low in price, light weight, biodegradable, have good adhesion to the matrix, and have a broad prospect as reinforcements. However, the degradation of PFs in the alkaline matrix is one of the main factors that affects the durability of these composites. PFs have good compatibility with cement and the geopolymer matrix. They can induce gel growth of cement-based materials and have a good toughening effect. The water absorption of the hollow structure of the PF can accelerate the degradation of the fiber on the one hand and serve as the inner curing fiber for the continuous hydration of the base material on the other. PF is easily deteriorated in the alkaline matrix, which has a negative effect on composites. The classification and properties of PFs, the bonding mechanism of the interface between PF reinforcements and the matrix, the water absorption of PF, and its compatibility with the matrix were summarized. The degradation of PFs in the alkaline matrix and solution, drying and wetting cycle conditions, and high-temperature conditions were reviewed. Finally, some paths to improve the alkaline degradation of PF reinforcement in the alkaline matrix were proposed.</p>},

Regression analysis based on the generalized estimating equations (GEE) is an increasingly important method for such data. However, there seem to be few model‐selection criteria available in GEE. The well‐known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) cannot be directly applied since AIC is based on maximum likelihood estimation while GEE is nonlikelihood based. We propose a modification to AIC, where the likelihood is replaced by the quasi‐likelihood and a proper adjustment is made for the penalty term. Its performance is investigated through simulation studies. For illustration, the method is applied to a real data set. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>X‐ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used in the study of the effect of microwave (MW) heating on the structural properties of cotton celluloses I and II and on the mercerization mechanism of cotton fibers. Samples of celluloses I and II were MW heated at 900 W for different times ranging from 10 to 40 min. The obtained data revealed that MW heating of cellulose II in opened glass tubes produces no significant effects on the resolution of its XRD patterns, whereas the most evident effects occur when cotton fibers (cellulose I) are heated in opened tubes at 900 W for 10 and 20 min. Also, mixtures of cotton fibers and aqueous solution of NaOH with different concentrations were exposed to MW radiation for different times and different powers. It was found that MW heating has no considerable effects on the mechanism of transformation of cellulose I into cellulose II during mercerization. On the other hand, MW heating of cotton fibers during mercerization reduces the values of concentration of NaOH in the aqueous solution and the time of treatment that are needed for the complete transformation of cellulose lattice type I into cellulose lattice type II without any heating. Also it was found that the magnitude of reductions depends on the applied power. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2007</p>},

abstract="Many fungi degrade cellulose and hemicelluloses using extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, but fungi that degrade woody biomass are the only ones to efficiently degrade polysaccharides encased in lignin. White-rot basidiomycetes begin by mineralizing the lignin, using extracellular oxidative enzymes to cleave this recalcitrant biopolymer. Enzymes with likely roles include lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, versatile peroxidases and laccases. In some cases the enzyme may attack the lignin polymer directly; in others the ligninolytic agent is likely a small molecule that one of the enzymes has oxidized to a reactive form. So far, all white rot fungi appear to secrete manganese peroxidases, and most produce laccases, whereas the other two enzymes are less common. After ligninolysis, white-rot fungi assimilate the remaining polysaccharides using conventional glycosylhydrolase systems that contain both endo- and exo-acting enzymes. Brown rot basidiomycetes also degrade lignocellulose efficiently, but their biodegradative systems are less comprehensive. These fungi generally lack ligninolytic enzymes, initiating decay instead with reactive oxygen species generated from the reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2. The limited disruption caused by these oxidants apparently allows a limited set of endo-acting glycosylhydrolases to depolymerize the remaining polysaccharides. Biological wood pulping is one promising application of ligninolytic fungi.",

@article{Bai2022,
   abstract = {Coastal tidal flats have received considerable attention in recent years, as they provide a direct channel for the discharge of terrestrial microplastics into the ocean. Land reclamation is occurring increasingly frequently in coastal tidal-flats; however, the environmental impacts of these activities remain unclear. Therefore, this pioneering study assessed the microplastic emission characteristics of reclamation geotextiles and performed a risk assessment accordingly. Morphological characterization of geotextile samples collected from five sites in Dongtai, China, provided evidence of sedimentary weathering. Based on several assumptions, the average abundance of microplastics in soil covered by geotextiles was estimated to reach 349±137 particles/kg dry weight, with the total microplastic load in the reclaimed area estimated to be 20.67±8.06 t. Compared with previous studies, this research demonstrates that coastal reclamation areas store a high concentration of microplastics, aggravating marine microplastic pollution. Moreover, conditional fragmentation model results revealed that the weathering and distribution characteristics of soil microplastics in coastal tidal-flat areas exhibit spatial heterogeneity, being more easily affected by natural factors (such as tides) than those in inland areas. As a result of tides, the annual discharge of geotextile-originating microplastics from the studied areas into the ocean was approximately 2465.52±960.77 t. These findings prove that the risks posed by engineering-microplastics are significant, indicating that further investigations are required on the precise laws of transfer and migration, as well as the toxicity mechanisms, in order to improve analytical techniques and policies in this field.},

   abstract = {A new and relatively simple equation for the soil‐water content‐pressure head curve, θ(h), is described in this paper. The particular form of the equation enables one to derive closed‐form analytical expressions for the relative hydraulic conductivity, Kr, when substituted in the predictive conductivity models of N.T. Burdine or Y. Mualem. The resulting expressions for Kr(h) contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by fitting the proposed soil‐water retention model to experimental data. Results obtained with the closed‐form analytical expressions based on the Mualem theory are compared with observed hydraulic conductivity data for five soils with a wide range of hydraulic properties. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is predicted well in four out of five cases. It is found that a reasonable description of the soil‐water retention curve at low water contents is important for an accurate prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.},

   abstract = {Hormonal regulation and symbiotic relationships provide benefits for plants to overcome stress conditions. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) application on root hydraulic conductivity (L) of Phaseolus vulgaris plants which established arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis under two water regimes (well-watered and drought conditions). The variation in endogenous contents of several hormones (MeJA, JA, abscisic acid (ABA), indol-3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA)) and the changes in aquaporin gene expression, protein abundance and phosphorylation state were analyzed. AM symbiosis decreased L under well-watered conditions, which was partially reverted by the MeJA treatment, apparently by a drop in root IAA contents. Also, AM symbiosis and MeJA prevented inhibition of L under drought conditions, most probably by a reduction in root SA contents. Additionally, the gene expression of two fungal aquaporins was upregulated under drought conditions, independently of the MeJA treatment. Plant aquaporin gene expression could not explain the behaviour of L. Conversely, evidence was found for the control of L by phosphorylation of aquaporins. Hence, MeJA addition modified the response of L to both AM symbiosis and drought, presumably by regulating the root contents of IAA and SA and the phosphorylation state of aquaporins.},

   abstract = {Reliance on ecosystem services instead of synthetic, non-renewable inputs is increasingly seen as key to achieving food security in an environmentally sustainable way. This process, known as ecological intensification, will depend in large part on enhancing below-ground biological interactions that facilitate resource use efficiency. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations formed between the roots of most terrestrial plant species and a specialized group of soil fungi, provide valuable ecosystem services, but the full magnitude of these services may not be fully realized under conventional intensively managed annual agricultural systems. Here, we use meta-analysis to assess how reducing soil disturbance and periods without roots in agricultural systems affect the formation of AM and the diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We compiled data from 54 field studies across five continents that measured effects of tillage and/or cover cropping on AMF colonization and/or communities and assessed effects of management and environmental factors on these responses. Less intensive tillage and winter cover cropping similarly increased AMF colonization of summer annual cash crop roots by ∼30%. The key variables influencing the change in AMF colonization were the type of cover crop or the type of alternative tillage, suggesting that farmers can optimize combinations of tillage and cover crops that most enhance AM formation, particularly with no-till systems and legume cover crops. Richness of AMF taxa increased by 11% in low-intensity vs. conventional tillage regimes. Several studies showed changes in diversity and community composition of AMF with cover cropping, but these responses were not consistent. Synthesis and applications. This meta-analysis indicates that less intensive tillage and cover cropping are both viable strategies for enhancing root colonization from indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) across a wide range of soil types and cash crop species, and possibly also shifting AMF community structure, which could in turn increase biologically based resource use in agricultural systems.},

@article{Larrainzar2017,
   abstract = {Legume plants are key elements in sustainable agriculture and represent a significant source of plant-based protein for humans and animal feed worldwide. One specific feature of the family is the ability to establish nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria. Additionally, like most vascular flowering plants, legumes are able to form a mutualistic endosymbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. These beneficial associations can enhance the plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Understanding how symbiotic interactions influence and increase plant stress tolerance are relevant questions toward maintaining crop yield and food safety in the scope of climate change. Proteomics offers numerous tools for the identification of proteins involved in such responses, allowing the study of sub-cellular localization and turnover regulation, as well as the discovery of post-translational modifications (PTMs). The current work reviews the progress made during the last decades in the field of proteomics applied to the study of the legume-Rhizobium and -AM symbioses, and highlights their influence on the plant responses to pathogens and abiotic stresses. We further discuss future perspectives and new experimental approaches that are likely to have a significant impact on the field including peptidomics, mass spectrometric imaging, and quantitative proteomics.},

With panel estimation techniques, our findings establish cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across the countries. We confirm the evidence of long-run dynamics between economic growth, and traditional and energy-related inputs. Findings from long-run output elasticities indicate that renewable energy consumption has a significant positive impact on the economic output for 57% of our selected countries. For robustness, we also carried out time-series analyses of long-run output elasticities. Our findings suggest that governments, energy planners, international cooperation agencies and associated bodies must act together in increasing renewable energy investment for low carbon growth in most of these economies.},

The effects of cellulose and sucrose addition on amino sugars and ergosterol were studied in a short-term laboratory experiment using two different soils under controlled conditions. Glucosamine (GlcN) and galactosamine (GalN) are components of bacterial and fungal cell walls. Their molar ratio (GlcN/GalN) indicates whether bacteria or fungi dominate the microbial community. Ergosterol is a specific component of fungal membranes. In both soils investigated, GlcN and GalN increased significantly after sucrose and cellulose addition compared with the control. The GlcN/GalN molar ratio decreased significantly with cellulose addition, indicating an increase in fungal residues, but increased with sucrose addition in one soil, indicating an increase in bacterial residues. Ergosterol increased significantly with cellulose addition, confirming the conclusions drawn from amino sugar analysis. These results clearly demonstrate that different substrates lead to different shifts in the microbial community composition.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to perform a multifaceted analysis of the behavior of natural fibers geotextiles from Typha domingensis, Eleocharis sp., and Syagrus coronata under environmental stressors over 120 days. Twenty-four fibers samples were selected, each 7 cm length, under field exposure, from the mentioned species. The majority of these samples underwent treatment with waterproofing acrylic styrene resin at two concentrations: 0.324 mg/mL (0.0324%) for a single layer and 0.648 mg/mL (0.0648%) for a double layer, while control samples remained untreated. Fracture analysis was conducted using digital processing of scanning electron microscopy images, revealing diferent degrees of resistance to degradation influenced by different treatments and exposure times. Typha domingensis fibers treated with the higher concentration resin (0.0648%) showed a remarkable reduction in cracking, presenting an improvement of 350.6% in durability compared to untreated fibers. Eleocharis sp. fibers treated with a double layer of resin (0.0648%) demonstrated better resistance to degradation, with a fracture reduction of 75.36% compared to untreated fibers and a notable improvement over the single-layer treatment (0.0324%). No statistically significant difference between the single-layer and double-layer resin treatments was observed in Syagrus coronata fibers, which nevertheless displayed inherent resistance to degradation even without treatment. Typha domingensis fibers exhibited better physical performance, probably due to their favorable morphological and structural characteristics and intrinsic composition. These findings highlight the critical role of additives and protective treatments in enhancing the durability and mechanical strength of geotextiles, while underscoring the distinct responses of different fiber species to chemical additives.},

abstract = {The problem of water contamination with heavy metals is a global one with its continuous challenges, and new cost-effective and sustainable remediation procedures are required. The paper is a critical review of the recent advancement in the mechanism of adsorption of heavy metals with low-cost absorbents, with the emphasis on water purification technologies that are imminent towards commercial usage in the future. We explore the dominant adsorbing mechanisms, such as physical/chemical adsorption, ion exchange/complexation, and electrostatic and surface-precipitation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of surface treatments through various functional groups, acid and base treatment of adsorbent materials, temperature, and pH of the adsorption process. Furthermore, we have also investigated the quantitative modeling of the adsorption process in order to correlate the adsorption mechanism with sorption capacity. The efficiency of carbon-based materials, clay minerals, and magnetic adsorbents is examined, along with biological materials such as microorganisms and plant biomass. The adsorption potential of plant-derived materials (e.g., seeds, bark, peel, root, and leaf powder) for Pb, Hg, Cr, Cd, Zn, Cu, Mn, and As removal is discussed. Furthermore, the suitability of agricultural and municipal waste as adsorbents is assessed. Areas to be developed in the future involve predictive models, long-term stability, and real-world validation as a means of addressing the technological gap between lab-scale innovation and industrial application.}

abstract = {Researchers have a poor understanding of the mechanisms that allow freshwater marshes to achieve rates of net primary production (NPP) that are higher than those reported for most other types of ecosystems. We used an 8-year record of the gross primary production (GPP) and NPP at the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh (SJFM) in Southern California to determine the relative importance of GPP and carbon use efficiency (CUE; the ratio of total NPP to GPP calculated as NPP GPP−1) in determining marsh NPP. GPP was calculated from continuous eddy covariance measurements and NPP was calculated from annual harvests. The NPP at the SJFM was typical of highly productive freshwater marshes, while the GPP was similar to that reported for other ecosystem types, including some with comparatively low NPPs. NPP was weakly related to GPP in the same year, and was better correlated with the GPP summed from late in the previous year's growing season to early in the current growing season. This lag was attributed to carbohydrate reserves, which supplement carbon for new leaf growth in the early growing season of the current year. The CUE at the SJFM for the 8-year period was 0.61±0.05. This CUE is larger than that reported for tropical, temperate, and boreal ecosystems, and indicates that high marsh NPP is attributable to a high CUE and not a high GPP. This study underscores the importance of autotrophic respiration and carbon allocation in determining marsh NPP.}

   abstract = { Drainage has turned 650,000 km 2 of peatlands worldwide into greenhouse gas sources. To counteract climate change, large‐scale rewetting is necessary while agricultural use of rewetted areas, termed paludiculture, is still possible. However, more information is required on the performance of suitable species, such as cattail, in the range of environmental conditions after rewetting. We investigated productivity and biomass quality (morphological traits and tissue chemical composition) of Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia along gradients of water table depth (−45 to +40 cm) and nutrient addition (3.6–400 kg N ha −1  a −1 ) in a six‐month mesocosm experiment with an emphasis on their high‐value utilization, e.g., as building material, paper, or biodegradable packaging. Over a wide range of investigated conditions, T. latifolia was more productive than T. angustifolia . Productivity was remarkably tolerant of low nutrient addition, suggesting that long‐term productive paludiculture is possible. Low water tables were beneficial for T. latifolia productivity and high water tables for T. angustifolia biomass quality. Rewetting will likely create a mosaic of different water table depths. Our findings that the yield of T. angustifolia and tissue chemical composition of T. latifolia were largely unaffected by water table depth are therefore promising. Depending on intended utilization, optimal cultivation conditions and preferable species differ. Considering yield or diameter, e.g., for building materials, T. latifolia is generally preferable over T. angustifolia . A low N, P, K content, high Si content and high C/N‐ratio can be beneficial for processing into disposable tableware, charcoal, or building material. For these utilizations, T. angustifolia is preferable at high water tables, and both species should be cultivated at a low nutrient supply. When cellulose and lignin contents are relevant, e.g., for paper and biodegradable packaging, T. angustifolia is preferable at high water tables and both species should be cultivated at nutrient additions of about 20 kg N ha −1  a −1 . },

   abstract = {Cellulose can be isolated from various raw materials and agricultural side streams and might help to reduce the dietary fiber gap in our diets. However, the physiological benefits of cellulose upon ingestion are limited beyond providing fecal bulk. It is barely fermented by the microbiota in the human colon due to its crystalline character and high degree of polymerization. These properties make cellulose inaccessible to microbial cellulolytic enzymes in the colon. In this study, amorphized and depolymerized cellulose samples with an average degree of polymerization of less than 100 anhydroglucose units and a crystallinity index below 30% were made from microcrystalline cellulose using mechanical treatment and acid hydrolysis. This amorphized and depolymerized cellulose showed enhanced digestibility by a cellulase enzyme blend. Furthermore, the samples were fermented more extensively in batch fermentations using pooled human fecal microbiota, with minimal fermentation degrees up to 45% and a more than eight-fold increase in short-chain fatty acid production. While this enhanced fermentation turned out to be highly dependent on the microbial composition of the fecal pool, the potential of engineering cellulose properties to increased physiological benefit was demonstrated.},

The predictive model achieved an R2 of 0.9451 and adjusted R2 of 0.8812.

The biosurfactant displayed high emulsification indices, exceeding 70% for canola, licuri, and motor oils, suggesting strong potential as an industrial emulsifier. FTIR and NMR analyses confirmed its glycolipid structure. Bioassays showed no toxicity to Lactuca sativa seeds, ensuring environmental safety, while antimicrobial tests demonstrated efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, indicating its suitability as a biocidal agent.

   abstract = {<p>Environmental pollution, such as air, water, and soil pollution, has become the most serious issue. Soil pollution is a major concern as it generally affects the lands and makes them non-fertile. The main cause of soil pollution is agro-waste. It may be possible to mitigate the agro-waste pollution by re-utilizing this agro-waste, namely natural fibres (NFs), by blending into polymer-based material to reinforce the polymer composite. However, there are pros and cons to this approach. Consequently, the polymer composite materials fabricated using NFs are inferior to those polymer composites that are reinforced by, e.g., carbon or glass fibres from the mechanical properties’ perspectives. The limitations of utilizing natural fibres in polymer matrix are their high moisture absorption, resulting in high swelling rate and degradation, inferior resistance to fire and chemical, and inferior mechanical properties. In particular, the NF polymer composites exhibit inferior interfacial adhesion between the fibre and the matrix, which, if improved, ultimately overcome all the listed limitations and improve the mechanical properties of the developed composites. To improve the interfacial adhesion leading to the enhancement of the mechanical properties, optimum chemical treatment such as Alkalization/Mercerization of the fibres have been explored. This article discusses the Mercerization/Alkali surface treatment method for NFs and its effects on the fibres regarding the Mercerization/Alkali surface treatment method for NFs and its effect on the fibres regarding their utilization in the polymer composites, the morphological features, and mechanical properties of composites.</p>},

The use of natural fibers turns engineering work more sustainable, since they are renewable, biodegradable, energy efficient and non-toxic raw materials. In this work, the influence of degradation caused by UV rays, heat and moisture on the mechanical behavior of vegetal natural fibers used in geotextiles, including sisal, coir and banana fibers, was studied. Natural fibers have been subjected to accelerate aging agents using QUV equipment and to real conditions, in contact with soil over a 3 months period. Samples were removed every 15 days and their mechanical behaviour evaluated under tensile. Moreover, the morphological modifications in the fibers structure have been also analyzed using SEM. The results show a significant degradation over the first 15 days for all types of fibers used. Sisal and banana fibers subjected to degradation in soil, present higher tensile strength loss over time than fibers subjected to accelerate aging tests in QUV. For geotextiles design, important remarks from the results can be obtained including: banana fibers are quite degraded by aging and soil conditions making them difficult to be applied in geotechnical engineering; sisal and coir fibers present high potential to perform various functions in contact with soil.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Banana fibres (BFs), derived from the pseudo-stems of Musa acuminata, represent a widely available agricultural residue with strong potential as an eco-friendly reinforcement in composite materials—particularly in bio-based epoxy or thermoplastic systems used in automotive interiors, packaging, and lightweight construction. However, their inherent variability presents challenges for consistent and reliable mechanical characterisation. This study investigates the effect of wood ash treatment, an eco-friendly alternative to conventional alkaline processing, on the tensile strength of single BFs. Fibres were treated in aqueous wood ash solutions at two pH levels (12.4 and 13.5) and soaking durations of 3 h and 24 h, and then tested according to ASTM C1557. At least 50 valid tensile tests per series were performed, and the results were analysed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution to quantify characteristic strength and variability, complemented by reliability analysis to assess survival probability. Untreated fibres exhibited low characteristic strength (396.6 MPa) and a Weibull modulus of 1.79, confirming significant scatter. Treated fibres showed marked improvements: the highest characteristic strength was achieved at pH 13.5 for 3 h (552.8 MPa, m = 3.17), while the greatest uniformity was observed at pH 13.5 for 24 h (m = 4.62). Reliability curves confirmed superior performance of treated fibres, with 75% survival strengths up to 373 MPa compared to 198 MPa for untreated. These findings demonstrate that wood ash treatment enhances both the strength and reliability of BFs for sustainable composite applications.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>This paper reviews the findings in the area of fatigue damage assessment and lifetime prediction of short fiber reinforced polymer composites (SFRPs) under cyclic loading. It is shown that the direct methods of microstructure/damage inspection are the most sensitive and informative, while micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) is more laborious and possesses limitations in sample dimensions. Although the sensitivity of the indirect methods can vary, the most common one is based on stiffness reduction. It is shown that developing models of fatigue processes is impossible without assessing the degree of damage. The latter can be determined by stiffness reduction, the development of creep, or energy dissipation. Since fatigue mechanisms can differ, the most complete information can be obtained by combining these methods. The prediction results for fatigue life models based on plastic strain development showed the greatest agreement with the experimental results in comparison with other prediction models. In addition, some tasks are highlighted as the priority directions for the development of SFRPs and non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for their monitoring under fatigue.</p>},

This knowledge not only serves as an important diagnostic signature for identifying the type(s) of microbial attacks present in such woods but also aids in the development of targeted methods for more effective preservation/restoration of wooden objects of historical and cultural importance. In this review, an outline of the chemical and ultrastructural characteristics of wood cell walls is first presented, which serves as a base for understanding the relationship of these characteristics to microbial degradation of lignocellulosic cell walls. The micromorphological patterns of the three different types of microbial attacks—soft rot, bacterial tunnelling and bacterial erosion—reported to be present in waterlogged woods are described. Then, the relevance of understanding microbial decay patterns to the preservation of waterlogged archaeological wooden artifacts is discussed, with a final section proposing research areas for future exploration.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Cellulose fibers are an abundant material that is well known for its biodegradability. Various forms of cellulose, such as cotton, paper pulp fibers, and microcrystalline cellulose can be regarded as benchmarks for biodegradability, when comparing other materials. However, as revealed by the literature, broad ranges of time and extent of biodegradation have been reported for cellulose. These large ranges can be attributed not only to environmental factors but also to the presence of lignin, the degree and perfection of crystallinity, the size and density of the physical specimens, and chemical modifications to the cellulose, if any. Studies also have shown differences in biodegradability associated with the selection of test methods. Although cellulose is subject to well-known enzyme-promoted mechanisms of biodegradation, the evolution of plant materials has favored development of some resistance to decay, i.e. recalcitrance. Cellulosic materials are clearly less biodegradable than starch. However, they are more biodegradable than various synthetic or bio-based plastics, as well as some cellulose derivatives, which persist in ocean water or soils for very long periods. This review indicates that cellulose biodegradability, while generally rapid and natural, has a rate and extent that depends on a complex and sometimes subtle set of environmental and chemical factors.</p>},

@article{Verma2021,
   abstract = {<p>Environmental pollution, such as air, water, and soil pollution, has become the most serious issue. Soil pollution is a major concern as it generally affects the lands and makes them non-fertile. The main cause of soil pollution is agro-waste. It may be possible to mitigate the agro-waste pollution by re-utilizing this agro-waste, namely natural fibres (NFs), by blending into polymer-based material to reinforce the polymer composite. However, there are pros and cons to this approach. Consequently, the polymer composite materials fabricated using NFs are inferior to those polymer composites that are reinforced by, e.g., carbon or glass fibres from the mechanical properties’ perspectives. The limitations of utilizing natural fibres in polymer matrix are their high moisture absorption, resulting in high swelling rate and degradation, inferior resistance to fire and chemical, and inferior mechanical properties. In particular, the NF polymer composites exhibit inferior interfacial adhesion between the fibre and the matrix, which, if improved, ultimately overcome all the listed limitations and improve the mechanical properties of the developed composites. To improve the interfacial adhesion leading to the enhancement of the mechanical properties, optimum chemical treatment such as Alkalization/Mercerization of the fibres have been explored. This article discusses the Mercerization/Alkali surface treatment method for NFs and its effects on the fibres regarding the Mercerization/Alkali surface treatment method for NFs and its effect on the fibres regarding their utilization in the polymer composites, the morphological features, and mechanical properties of composites.</p>},

   abstract = {Recently, there has been a rapid growth in research and innovation in the natural fibre composite (NFC) area. Interest is warranted due to the advantages of these materials compared to others, such as synthetic fibre composites, including low environmental impact and low cost and support their potential across a wide range of applications. Much effort has gone into increasing their mechanical performance to extend the capabilities and applications of this group of materials. This review aims to provide an overview of the factors that affect the mechanical performance of NFCs and details achievements made with them.},
